# 3D Maze
- project: 3D Java Maze
  role: Sole Developer
  duration: November 2018
  url: "https://github.com/ab1manyu/java3DMaze"
  description: Utilized Java's Abstract Window Toolkit library to develop a maze game. This started off as a simple 2D maze modeled from a text file of o's and spaces. I then used AWT to draw polygons in a way that the maze looked "3D" using perspective and filling.

# Android Weather App
- project: Android Weather App
  role: Sole Developer
  duration: January 2018 
  url: "https://github.com/ab1manyu/androidWeatherApp"
  description: I've used the OpenWeather API to create a weather forecast application for Android devices. This project taught me a lot about using REST APIs; how sending requests and displaying information works. In addition, it shows the weather in 3 hour intervals and is Pok√©mon themed depending on the type of current weather.
